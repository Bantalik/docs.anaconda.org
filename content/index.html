Anaconda Cloud makes it easy to find, access, store and share public and private notebooks, environments, and 
conda and PyPI packages, and to keep up with updates made to the packages and environments you’re using.

You can build packages using the Anaconda client CLI, then manually or automatically upload the packages 
to Anaconda Cloud to quickly share with others or access yourself from anywhere. 

To take advantage of Anaconda Cloud, you’ll first want to:

- [Download Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

- Get familiar with using conda. A good place to start is the [conda cheat sheet](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/cheatsheet.html)
and the [conda test drive](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/test-drive.html).

For developers, Anaconda Cloud is designed to make software development, release, and maintenance easy by providing 
broad package management support. Anaconda Cloud allows for both free <strong>public</strong> and paid <strong>private</strong> 
package repositories, as well as package channels, providing a flexible and scalable service for groups and 
organizations of all sizes. Anaconda Cloud is a [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io) product.

Hosting of freely available software will always remain free for individuals and organizations hosting up to twenty 
public packages.  There is a small fee for the hosting of private packages or more than twenty 
packages. For more information, please see our [plan options](https://anaconda.org/about/pricing).

We welcome your [feedback and suggestions](mailto:support@anaconda.org).

## USING ANACONDA CLOUD

To take advantage of Anaconda Cloud, [download Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), get 
the [conda cheat sheet](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/cheatsheet.html)
and the [conda test drive](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/test-drive.html).

### Search for a public package

Anaconda Cloud hosts hundreds of useful Python packages for a wide variety of applications. You don’t need to have an Anaconda Cloud account, or be logged in, to search for public packages, download and install them. 
You need an account only to access private packages, or to create and share your packages with others.

**Search for a public package on Anaconda Cloud**

1. In the top search box, type part or all of the name of a program you are searching for and press Enter.
2. Packages that match your search string are displayed. Click the package name to see more information.

**Refine your search results**

You can filter search results using three filter controls:
  * All packages, conda only or PyPI only
  * All types, Public and/or Private (only available if you are logged in)
  * Platforms: All, Source*, Linux-32, Linux-64, Noarch**, OSX-64, Win-32, Win-64.  
    *“Source” packages are source code only, not yet built for any specific platform.  
    **“Noarch” packages are built to work on all platforms.

**Download a package from Anaconda Cloud**

After you have located a package and clicked on the name, the detail page displays specific install instructions for the current operating system. Copy and paste the full command into your terminal window.

EXAMPLE: To install a package with conda run:

    conda install -c https://anaconda.org/USERNAME packagename




## BUILDING PACKAGES WITH ANACONDA CLOUD

Open an Anaconda Cloud account to build packages, to access private packages and/or to build packages for operating systems other than Linux. To build private packages, upgrade to a paid account. 

To build and upload packages, install the Anaconda Client Command Line Client (CLI) and Anaconda Build. 
Open a Terminal window and enter:

    conda install anaconda-client anaconda-build

Next, log into your Anaconda Cloud account. In your terminal window, enter the following:

    anaconda login
    
At the prompt, enter your Anaconda Cloud username and password. 

Next, choose the package you would like to build. For this quickstart, you can download our [test package](https://github.com/Anaconda-Server/binstar/tree/master/example-packages/conda):

	git clone https://github.com/Anaconda-Server/anaconda-client
	cd anaconda-client/example-packages/conda/

To build your test package, first turn off automatic anaconda-client uploading, then 
run the conda build command:

    conda config --set anaconda_upload no
    conda build .

Check the path where the newly built file was placed with the `--output` option:

    conda build . --output

Finally, upload your newly built test package to your Anaconda Cloud account:

    anaconda login
    anaconda upload #userdefined{/path/to/conda-package.tar.bz2}

For detailed information, see the [building packages](examples.html#HowToUploadACondaPackage) section.
